The government, in the form of a council of scientists, was elected in a free and secret election. In the following years, the harsh environment took a heavy toll on the people in the newly-established city. Research efforts were initially concentrated on survival in the hostile environment. The departure of the 'Avenger' in 2654 was incomprehensible for the population of Tech Haven. The prevailing opinion was that humanity should only leave Earth after its ecology has been restored. In 2658 Frederick Lauster of BioTech Industries joined Tech Haven. The living conditions gradually improved in Tech Haven during the following years and many new inventions were presented to the scientist council. Some of them proved to be very useful when Lioon Reza and his troops bring about the downfall of the ruling Psi-Monks, which was followed by the signing of an official recognition agreement by Neocron's new leader.";

set 2020 "Twilight Guardian was founded by Reza and Yager in 2722. The objective of the co-founders was to overthrow the government of the Psi-Monks from within the underground. The group experienced tremendous support from all parts of society. The coup was planned for the following year. Lioon, who had become more and more aggressive during the past months, planed to chase the Psi-Monks out of the city by force.";
set 2021 "In 2724 the Twilight Guardian managed to overthrow the government of the Psi-Monks and to drive the government members from the city. Many Psi-Monks from the former government withdrew to the old Crahn Abbey in the Wastelands. In the aftermath of the victory, a dispute evolved between Yager and Lioon. Lioon publicly declared that he planned to take over Neocron, thus betraying the mutual plan to establish a democracy in Neocron. The next morning Lioon had the CityAdmin building surrounded by black and white robot-like creatures which drove the members of the Twilight Guardian out of the building. Yager could not explain Lioon's sudden change of heart, nor did he know where the strange creatures came from. They later became known as Cop- and STORM-Bots. One year later Lioon had established himself as the new dictator of Neocron. He installed the CopBot system in the city. Laws were strongly simplified, penalties greatly increased. In 2726 Yager, feeling betrayed, knew that he had to start anew.";
set 2022 "He decided to continue leading the Twilight Guardians and set a new goal; to overthrow Lioon Reza. The majority of the former followers joined him. The resistance was built up again and a modern secret base built in the Wastelands. In spite of several attacks, the Guardian cannot effectively succeed in weakening Lioon's power in 2750. The army of Cop- and STORM-Bots that protects the CityAdmin 24 hours a day is too strong. Yager is now an old man, who feels that his time is running out.";

Together they founded the rebel organization which fought against the reign of the Psi-Monks for the freedom of Neocron's citizens. Full of idealism, Hagen believed in Lioon's democratic objectives and convictions which he had shared since his youth in the suppressed city of Neocron. However, since Lioon established himself as dictator of Neocron, Hagen leads the resistance against his former comrade.";

//CONNECTIONS
set 2060 "Since the rebels cannot afford to be selective in choosing their allies at the moment, they even try to stay on good terms with the Brotherhood of Crahn. After all, they do have a common enemy in the government, although it is obvious that the factions could never agree on a specific political system. The Fallen Angels, like the Anarchy Breed, are allied to the resistance fighters by their conviction that the present governmental system is not the right thing. The scientists supply medication and information to the Guardian and are in return protected by the rebels at all times.";

Consequently, all legal (and therefore pro-government) companies in Neocron are also opposed to the Twilight Guardian. These are BioTech Industries, Tangent Technologies Inc., NEXT Systems Inc and Diamond Real Estate. These companies employ the services of the CityMercs to fight the rebels. As a revolution would endanger the Black Dragon's real estate business, the Clan has no sympathies for Twilight Guardian either.";

On their fast Hoverbikes they reconnoitre the battlefield in the shortest of times. In heavy troop transports the own troops are brought into the battle area. Enemy troops are weakened decidedly and eliminated by heavy armour and from the air shots and bombs are sprinkled over the battle area. Most of the Drivers know about repairs, so that they can get their vehicles moving again in the field. The Private Eye is, because of his manifold talents, found behind the steering wheel as well as behind the onboard cannon. A GenTank could do these things without effort, but there are not too many GenTanks among the Drivers, as they have far better alternatives. Spies you will find as Drivers as well, even though they cannot operate the cannons, because of their lack of physical strength. You will find Hoverbike-riding Monks, there are no Monks that work vehicles exclusively.";
set 2110 "'A good weapon is like an additional body part'. Engineers build the weapons that will win the fight. An Engineer is constantly busy, because there is so much to build and, especially in arms, there is nothing to be left to amateurs. The better the Engineer, the better the result of his work. So only top specialists are employed.The Spy uses his intelligence and abilities to dominate this particular field, but some Monks have decided that speed is not all and give Spies a good run for their money.";
set 2120 "Who ever goes hunting without a Field Medic by his side must be very sure of himself. Whoever goes to war without at least one Field Medic is more or less lost already. Those Masters of Psionic can heal the wounded, shelter his comrades in arms, improve their abilities, and influence the opponent negatively. Because only Monks have the perfect abilities for those tasks and have a hang for things extreme, many of them have out of a sense for complexity learned the art to do implants.";
set 2130 "The Hacker is the key figure in just about all regions. Not only that he can crack any kind of electronic lock, he also has the Cyberspace of the Hacknet at his availability. In these he can surf  Networks like GenRep-Net and move freely from one place to another. Also he can penetrate into Fraction networks and bring sensible data about members of the network to his knowledge. In the fight for the Outposts he is irreplaceable, because without him Mainframes programmes cannot be altered. First choice for being a Hacker would be a Spy. But Monks could use their high intelligence to dive into the world of Hacking. Also many Private Eyes do not want to loose out on the privileges Hacking offers.";
set 2140 "The Inquisitor is known for his top grade aggressive psionic abilities and his remorseless personal abilities. An Inquisitor stands behind his duty, body and soul. Not even death could change that. For these fanatics there is only one target: To get things done according to their will. To achieve this, force is not only the second but the first choice! The Monk is because of his superior Psionic the logical alternative. No other class has psionic abilities to compete.";
set 2150 "The Preacher is used to a lonely life. Because he can't count on the help of a team, he is training his passive and offensive psionic abilities. Even though he cannot compete in either field with a specialist, he is an extremely tough opponent because he is such an extremely flexible solo fighter. Not that he would be lost within a team, but a team is served better with a specialist. Nobody but a Monk would become a Preacher because only Monks have the abilities in Psionic to have any mentionable success.";
set 2160 "The Scientist makes the blueprints an Engineer needs to build wanted items. Besides that he identifies strange parts of technology that The Hunters bring home from their trips into the Wasteland. Many Scientists have a collection of blueprints at hand to sell copies of them to those that do not have an in-house Scientist or to Engineers that want to sell made up weapons..

Smugglers offer their extraordinary abilities to dicker or buy merchandise beforehand and offer them for a profit. Lots of intelligence needed, a job for Monks and Spies.";
set 2180 "The Assassin is a specialist for remote fighting. Whoever gets hit by bullets in the open field is almost always the target of an Assassin. These specialists use Sniper rifles or assault rifles. Because of these weapons the targets hardly ever find out which directions the bullets came from. Some Assassins know of the art of implants, others are formidable Hackers. 'Hit and Run' is the most used practice but some Assassins are good or only mad enough to go into an in-fight with their rifles to create havoc there. These hotheads are mainly Private Eyes. Spies can even be more deadly in their ways. Because of their physical deficits they always work with state of the art camouflage. They are about invisible in open field.";
set 2190 "The Infiltrator is a combination of reconnaissance and fighter. He is to find out about enemy strength and their strategic placing. For him Stealth tactics and camouflage technologies are vital. You will find him in the fight in short to medium distance. From here he thins out enemy troops. Many scouts have a fundamental knowledge in Hacking and are often seen on Hoverbikes which improve their manoeuvrability further. For those reasons the Spy is the only class to present good scouts. Private Eyes could become Infiltrators too but for them it is much harder because of their missing camouflage technology.";
set 2200 "'To give yourself into immediate danger is a thing of the past' is what the Riggers say. The Rigger is specialised to operate UAVs ( Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and is so fighting in the field by remote. But if he is discovered in his hiding the end will come soon, because being concentrated on his UAV he is defenceless. So he has to rely on camouflage as much as possible. Spies and Monks dominate this domain.";
set 2210 "The Soldier is THE heavy fighting unit in each group. It is at the front distributing plasma. With his heavy arms and armour he is the holy terror to those unlucky ones having attacked him. A sprinter he is not, but in extreme situations his staying abilities they often decide the fight. Here the GenTank shows his strength and fitness, he is the borne Soldier. But some Private Eyes, high from implants and drugs, which right there at the front, swinging big guns, give their bigger brothers a run for their money.";
set 2220 "The Street Samurai has decided on Sword and dagger. Big swords, metal claws are the dominating weapons in this profession. The Street Samurai does not carry heavy weapons nor plenty of ammunition. He is thus more manoeuvrable than his heavily armed brethren. He uses this ability in the fight and whoever underestimates him may find himself, cut into thin slices, on the floor seconds after he made his mistake. A job for GenTanks and Private Eyes.";

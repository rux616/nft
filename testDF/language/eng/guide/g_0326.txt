While most citizens dismiss the idea, radical doomsayers believe that the mutant infestation is an organized invasion. Of course, one would be hard pressed to find any proof of such an orginization. The mutant attacks are without pattern and without logic. Most citizens simply assume the mutants are more active, more daring with their attacks because Neocron's population has dwindled in the shadow of the Great Trek of 2746. The mutants are attempting to fill the vacuum.
Another rumored power isn't even made of flesh. Highly developed, autonomous artificial intelligences (AIs) are rumored to exist on the lower levels of the city's network. Supposedly uploaded to the network 100 years ago, they are said to have come directly off the the Ceres Discs. The dozen or so AIs have been blamed for network anomolies suck as massive, anonymous credit transfers and the exposure and dispersal of corporate information that has gone on to save lives. Referred to with names like “Ghost”, “Spirit” and “The Eye”, a subculture of worshippers has emerged who spend all their time jacked into the network, looking for their gods. Their existance has never been proven.
CityAdmin believes these other “factions” are simply fantasy. Official statements have likened the AIs to the polytheism of ancient times. As for the mutant organization, CityAdmin puts no weight in such an idea. Their incentive program has killed thousands upon thousands of mutants, and they've seen no evidence of an organization. Like most citizens, they believe that the powers of Neocron all have very public faces.

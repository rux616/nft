As soon as you have improved your skills and your equipment some you should think about taking on a mission for one of the numerous companies in Neocron. The companies and organisations always have open jobs. Just go to a CityCom terminal (those cannot only be found in your apartment but throughout the whole city at various accessible locations) and download the available missions. And it actually really makes sense to be loyal to a specific faction. The more missions you accomplish for them, the higher their confidence into your abilities. The loyalty you spend on a company or an organisation will definitely pay off after some time.

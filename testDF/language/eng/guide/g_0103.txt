The inner city is quite big, so to travel large distances between districts you should use the popular HoverCab Subway System. You'll seldom meet the rich and powerful Runners of Neocron there though, because they usually prefer to travel by using the so-called Gene Replicators (GenReps).
It works like this: if you pass by a GenRep you can store your DNA pattern there by activating the machine. Now you can 'teleport' from every other GenRep to this activated one. In the process your cell matrix is separated into its atomic components and transported to the activated GenRep. After the incoming DNA matrix has been successfully verified against the stored DNA pattern, you are being replicated at the activated GenRep. And though I always get a massive headache when using it, it is probably the most convenient and fast form of travelling in Neocron.
Basically GenReps only have two downsides. First, using them is extremely expensive and second, every GenRep has to be activated prior to using it as a destination. Be that as it may, especially for travelling to the vast Wastelands these things are essential.

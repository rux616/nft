Even the most basic human society cannot exist without certain groups of people who in one way or the other strive for power over other people. Neocron and its surrounding regions are no different in this regard. The city's history is stamped by the fights between varying political, industrial, religious and scientific organizations. This struggle for power had not started with the fights between historical figures like Thor and Crahn and it will certainly not end with contemporary conflicts like the one between Neocron's CityAdmin and the rebels of the Twilight Guardian, or the hidden war between the Tsunami Syndicate and the Black Dragon Clan.
No, the battlefields where differing opponents fight for more power over the known world of Neocron are numerous and well populated. The opponents are as mercyless as they are different. From the city's administration and government to the anarchists in the Outzone, from the warring criminal gangs to the massive corporations, from mercenaries out in the wastelands to the religiously fanatic followers of Crahn... all of them ultimately want to claim their place as the most powerful faction of Neocron.
And they need YOUR help to get there.

Around the end of the 27th century Earth is a nearly dead planet.
Climate.
Nations.
All were in upheavel.
The Ceres Wars, excessive environmental pollution, global warming and the contaminated radiation that enters through a perforated atmosphere, have turned this once blue planet into a grayish-brownish sphere of sludge. Humanity has long overcome its collective feeling of guilt for the state Earth is in, and has begun to search for a new home. Finally they make a strike in a distant part of space.
In the course of various decades gigantic treks transport the majority of humanity to the planet Irata III. The remnants of the world's population regrouped behind the protective walls of three teaming mega metropolis. Safety shields, artificial atmospheres and magnetic fields protect these cities against contaminated radiation and other influences from the devastated outside world.

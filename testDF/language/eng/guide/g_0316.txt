“Your hope. Your strength. Your cure.” One of the most lucrative businesses in society has always been medical care. This is what ProtoPharm base their entire financial concept on. They produce anything in the medical industry, ranging from the most basic of Medkits to miracle cures. Their biggest invention and most recognised achievement was the cryogenic chambers called “CryoVaultsTM”, which made the construction of the great settler starships for the Great Trek possible. This is closely followed by the “VitaeTM” multipurpose medication. Not even the “Spirula” scandal has managed to overshadow this. Spirula was a medication against radiation damage which lead to massive genetic damage among the bulk of the citizens, triggering a new wave of mutants in the years 2740-47.

Headquarters   
The ProtoPharm Inc. headquarters are situated in Via Rosso, sector two, close to the Tangent Tehcnologies headquarters. A long bridge-like structure whith multiple shops on it stretches from the edges of the sector to the entrance of the HQ. The interior of the company is just as impressive and clearly tells of ProtoPharm's waelth and power.
Players choosing ProtoPharm as their character's faction will start out in an apartment in Via Rosso.
The company's product line is mainly sold by the “Medicare” and “Taylor's Biochem” stores throughout the city.

Key Personalities   
Sandra Frasier, a 42 year old attractive career woman, is in charge of ProtoPharm. She is a brilliant and tough strategist, but also a great humanist. It is rumored that she started her career on the street-corners of Pepper Park and reached her current position by “entertaining” high level businessmen. Considering her kind and humanitarian nature though this topic is rarely, if ever, brought up.
19-year-old Luke Conrad, SysAdmin of ProtoPharm, is a marvel behind the keyboard. He does however have a slight mental disorder which requires him to take medication regularly. Lucky for him, he works for a company that has a never ending supply of medicine for his illness.

History   
ProtoPharm sees the light of day at 2646 with the merger of several medical and chemical companies. A young business attorney named Jakob Finster is chosen as manager. ProtoPharm starts up with decisive envolvement in Cryo research. The cryo chamber project for the passengers of the first spaceship “Avenger” is completed in 2652 and then taken a step further in 2658 with the creation of the CryoVaultsTM, offering every person the option to prolong their lives by sleeping in a cryogenic chamber for a virtually infinite timespan.
Finster enters one of the CryoVaultsTM himself in 2664 and management is handed over to Alain Finster, his nephew. Under Alains management ProtoPharm changes target group, shifting from the exclusive market segment to a rather mainstream approach. This change is the driving force for the VitaeTM multipurpose medication, which is introduced to the market in 2678.
In 2701 Alain disappears under mysterious circumstances and shortly thereafter the VitaeTM formula is stolen. Soon the Brotherhood of Crahn sells the medication as well, marking the end of ProtoPharm's monopoly on the highly lucrative drug.
Jan Pixner, Alain's successor, allies himself and the company whith Lioon Reza and support him in his efforts to overthrow the PSI Monk government. The drug “Spirula”is launched in 2739, under the management of Gene Manchia. It appears to be just as succesful as its predecessor but the success is shortlived as scientists prove that Spirula causes unpredictable genetic damage, leading to a scandal of enormous proportions.
In 2741 Sandra Frasier is appointed CEO of ProtoPharm. Lioon Reza declares the mutants to be nonhumans and killing them is regarded an act of mercy. This results in most of the mutants fleeing to the outer areas of the Outzone or into the Wastelands. ProtoPharm does their best to get out of the spotlight during the next few years and apparantly this is a somewhat succesful move as ProtoPharm and BioTech Industries agree on a cooperation contract in 2750.

Rumors   
Many odd stories float around the intriguing Sandra Frasier. For instance it is said that there is more to BioTech's and ProtoPharm's recent alliance than meets the eye and that Seymour Jordan's motives are far from being all business related.
In the same direction go numerous stories about the means Ms Frasier used on her way into the upper levels of management. Some of those stories might be true, but others depict a Sandra Frasier so cold blooded and calculating, that they cannot be believed by anyone in his or her right mind.
Rumor has it that the founder of ProtoPharm, Jakob Finster, fell terminally ill and therefore saw no other chance than to preserve himself in one of ProtoPharm's cryogenic chamber. Supposedly he is woken up every 20 years to see if he can be cured yet. But even if there was a cure, those who spread this rumor also say that Ms Frasier doesn't have the slightest interest in saving the old man.

Friend and Foe   
The company has strong ties whith BioTech Industries and most other Neocron corporations. One of the few exceptions is NEXT Inc. since Sandra Frasier started a raid on the transport systems company prior to the Great Trek. ProtoPharm also has good relations to the CityAdmin and the CityMercs.
Madame Veronique in her blind hate for drugs and everything related to them has publicly suspected ProtoPharm numerous times to conduct illegal business whith the Black Dragon Clan. Of course those blatant lies have been dismissed by ProtoPharm spokesmen and in the process the Tsunami Syndicate had to pay an undisclosed amount of money for compensation.

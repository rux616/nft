Irrespective of which career you want to pursue ...  in the beginning you are a nothing. In your apartment you will find a CityCom Terminal via which you can download missions, organize your emails and partake in forum discussions. By the way, don't be surprised that this terminal was made available to you for free, because just as with your apartment the government had a not so charitable thought in mind there: most hackers of Neocron are convinced that CityAdmin uses your CityCom terminal together with Tangent Technologies (who have had a monopoly on operating systems and communication applications for roughly 20 years now) to spy on you. Therefore it is not really surprising that even you can retrieve information on other citizens and organisations from the CityCom network. Protection of data privacy is wishful thinking in Neocron since the introduction of the Tangent CityCom terminal.
In fact most newcomers ignore the missions which can be downloaded at the terminal and instead they are convinced that starter money is best made in the sewers of the city. The sewer ducts below Plaza and ViaRosso are not that mucky, but crawling with vermin. So it's not the worst idea to just head out and hunt it down. The CityAdmin will transfer a small reward for every killed critter to your account. Furthermore the hunt is good practice to get used to small calibre weapons, knifes and so on. The canalization below the districts PepperPark and Outzone are tougher though. Some even report full-grown mutants and other dangerous creatures down there. Consider teaming up with others to fight in the challenging sewers of the city, because the money and the experience will be automatically distributed between members of such a group according to the damage each member dealt. This means that if you have fought forever with a mutated spider but some other guy deals the finishing blow, you will still get the major share of the reward and the experience.

Tangent Technologies Inc. (Tangent) is the main weapons developer / manufacturer in the city of Neocron. Originally an internal division of BioTech Industries (BioTech), Tangent broke from it's parent company in 2746. It's focus on the research and development of arms provided such quality that CityAdmin uses Tangent weapons to arm their CopBot squads.
The Tangent culture clearly revolves around personal safety and security. Their motto, “In guns we trust”, is really the perfect descriptor.

Headquarters   
Tangent's main offices are located in Via Rossa, Sector Two. You will find their headquarter directly across from the Nomstrom building. Though the entrance makes Tangent look like it was still a BioTech subsidiary, it should not deceive the unsuspecting observer. There is more to this company than meets the eye.
Players choosing Tangent Technologies as their character's faction will start out in an apartment in Via Rosso.
The Tangent Technologies product line is mainly sold via the numerous “Archer & Wesson” stores throughout the City of Neocron.

Key Personalities   
Robert Jordan owns both BioTech Industries and Tangent Technologies. In 2748, at age 90, Robert handed control of BioTech over to his younger son, Seymour. Robert gave control of Tangent to his older son, Damion. Robert told them that whomever proves themselves to be the better manager will be given control of both the companies.
Damion Jordan is a great manager, a great leader. With regards to the competition between him and his brother, Seymour, most analysts see Tangent as being in the lead. The rise in the mutant population is creating a boon in weapon sales from which Tangent benefits immensely.
Held up in Tangent's basement is Chester Cohor, the SysAdmin. Of course, he's held up there by his own accord. An addict of all things computer, Chester is a socially stunted 18 year-old, supposedly with a gift for hacking. As long as he provides the security and the services that Damion requires, Chester will have all the computing power he'll ever need.

History   
In 2658, BioTech created an arms division, Tangent Technologies. The division, headed up by BioTech co-founder Hester Gabun, developed arms for the resistance movement led by Lioon Reza, who overthrew the PSI Monk regime in 2724.
The relationship between the new CityAdmin and the Tangent division within BioTech was very strong as technologies developed at Tangent found their way into the CopBot and S.T.O.R.M.-Bot systems that CityAdmin used to successfully bring order back to the city. This relationship generated so much capital that BioTech spun off the Tangent division to its own company.
Tangent was incorporated in the first quarter of 2746. Damion Jordan was installed as company CEO and immediately moves the company to even greater profits by focusing on the safety and security of individual citizens in Neocron. New product lines, such as the armed mobile units developed in cooperation with NExT Systems Inc, provide consumers with more effective ways to protect themselves.
Today, with Tangent's help, many citizens are taking on personal initiatives to relieve the city of the mutant infestation and... other problems.

Rumors   
Not all of the weapons in Neocron are manufactured by Tangent. This, of course, is a situation with which Tangent is less than pleased. Tactics employed by Tangent to correct this are rumored to include contracted strikes by the CityMercs on these competing manufacturers and distributors.
A less believable rumor suggests that Tangent also uses the Black Dragon Clan for more shady dealings. The connection is expanded by a rumored drug problem plagueing Tangent CEO, Damion Jordan. It is unclear how an addict could run a major corporation as well as Damion does, but the rumor suggests that the Black Dragon Clan has been quietly supplying Damion for most of his adult life.
It may also be worth noting that information has surfaced regarding the “in development” load out for the CityAdmin CopBots. The numbers associated with the new load out are a tenfold increase in CopBot speed and a hundredfold increase in their lethality. Hackers have noted an increase in Tangent's network security, suspecting that this implies that Tangent's network was recently compromised. For this reason, the CopBot information is being taken very seriously. Chester Cohor, Tangent's SysAdmin, has stated that the increased security is simply “routine upgrading”.

Friend and Foe   
Tangent weapons are carried by the CopBots squads throughout the city. As such, Tangent is certainly a friend of CityAdmin. Diamond Real Estate also uses Tangent products for the home security systems in virtually all of their properties. NExT Systems Inc and Tangent also have a good relationship based on collaborations aimed at the continued development of mobile armed systems.
Like the other big corporations, Tangent would loose a great deal if the current administration was overthrown. This makes outfits like the Anarchy Breed rather undesirable to Tangent. Besides, the dissidents don't have nearly as much money to spend on Tangent products.

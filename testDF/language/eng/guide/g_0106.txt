If you succeed in founding a powerful clan it will not take long before the capturing of outposts (factories, laboratories, communication facilities, mines and forts) in the Wastelands appears on your agenda. The factions pay high rewards for acquiring and controlling resources. Just don't forget that there are other companies and clans in Neocron as well ...  and that a surprise attack could happen just when you have started to settle down in an outpost.
But it will surely take some time before you have turned from a beginner to a powerful clan member or even leader. Until then heed my advice to find as many friends and allies as possible in Neocron ...  because a group is always stronger than a lone gun.

Good luck, my friend ...

Not later than when you have accomplished some missions for the companies and organizations of the city, you will realize that the factions are not always well aligned to each other. But really complex missions will very seldom be given to separate individuals.
Factions are more likely to entrust missions to whole groups of their most loyal followers. A faction will offer you to found a faction clan as soon as the trust of that faction in your abilities has been proven by your loyalty. While being a member of this clan you will be allowed to take on complex missions for the faction, which might reach from escort missions to declaring war on other companies and their clans. On the other hand you may just join an existing clan and rise through its ranks by being a useful member of the group.

set 1 "The Pistol resembles archaic firearms in a lot of ways. A single bullet is loaded into the firing chamber where a hammer propels the projectile when the trigger is pulled.";
set 2 "In the multitude of high-tech weapons of the 28th century the ordinary Bat still serves as a cheap and low-maintenance weapon in close combat, not to be sneezed at. The additionally mounted piezoelectric cells on the surface provide an added electrical shock effect.";
set 3 "The Assault Rifle is a semi-automatic, short to medium range weapon, originally developed by Tangent. It uses 5.56mm standard ammo and can also be converted to use various types of ammunition.";
set 4 "The Fusion Cannon represents the latest development in cold-fusion weapon technology. Originally developed for the Heavy Weapon Support Teams of the City Mercs, the fusion cannon is distinguishable through high firepower and destructiveness. The disadvantages of the Fusion Cannon are its heavy weight and awkwardness.";
set 8 "The Phase-Induced Plasma Cannon, PIP Z85, uses a combination of plasma formation and ohmic plasma-ignition methods to maximize effectiveness. This technique uses particle-charged magnetic field beams induced into existing plasma, thereby multiplying the energy level of the plasma by 3.3 eV. The downside of this method is the relatively low density of the plasma charge, giving it a reduced kinetic impact effect. This however, is more than compensated by the higher energy level of the plasma charge. The intense heat of the plasma (10°6 K) incinerates almost anything along its path, inflicting severe heat damage to its targets. This makes the Z85 one of the strongest weapons on the battlefield. ";
set 9 "This Knife made of a special alloy is the standard melee combat and thrills, slicing through even the strongest materials with its extra-sharpened 10 mm carbon-steel blade.";
set 10 "The Stiletto is a pure stabbing weapon, with no cutting power. It is inconspicuous to carry and an elegant weapon of supreme quality.";
set 11 " Most plans for Grenade Launchers found in the Ceres project involved bullet type ammo, where the grenade was first shot like a slug and then a small payload of explosives was delivered. Calispicus, a former machinist in the Dome of York, decided it would be better to find a way to deliver a much larger payload without the risk of it exploding from the initial firing. After devising that hydraulics were much too heavy, he decided the best way to launch a grenade without any combustion was a pneumatic delivery system. He tore apart a small pneumatic forklift for parts and quickly went to work forging the chassis of the weapon. After producing a decidedly large, but functional prototype, he was given a team to help him refine and miniaturize it until they came up with a model similar to the current one. Since then the only real changes have been cosmetic.";
set 12 "The Laser Pistol causes damage by the extreme heat the beam emits. The heat of current laser guns is so high that it is able to melt through most kinds of armor, burning the flesh underneath. The heat emitted by the beam of the laser pistol is rather weak when compared to the beam which the rifle emits. The main effects of wounds caused by lasers are second to third degree burns. Bleeding and other secondary effects are just a minimal part of the damage.";
set 13 "The Laser Rifle causes damage as a result of the extreme heat which the beam emits. The heat of current laser guns is so high that it is able to melt through most kinds of armor, burning the flesh underneath. Laser rifles are able to shoot a beam that emits heat much stronger than the beam of an ordinary laser pistol. The main effects of wounds caused by lasers are second to third degree burns. Bleeding and other secondary effects are just a minimal part of the damage.";
set 14 "The Pulsar-Class Ray Gun is a disruptor weapon. Organic tissue is disintegrated on the subatomic level. This is achieved by firing neutron saturated beams at the target. A cold-fusion reactor powers a two-stage tandem micro-particle accelerator, the Synchrotron. The Synchrotron produces neutron (1.7 × 1027 Kg) particles with no electric charge. The output stream of the Synchrotron is guided to the Rutherford chamber by means of focusing magnetic fields. In the Rutherford chamber (a tube consisting of an array of magnetic lenses (AML) and a cooling system) the stream of neutrons is focused, synchronized, and magnetically contained by the AML system. Fired from the Rutherford chamber, the neutron beam leaves the nozzle where the magnetic containment field is discharged, freeing and accelerating the neutrons to 2000 m/s. The effect of the Ray Gun decreases noticeable with increasing length of the ray."; //new
set 15 "The Gluon-Boson Suspension Ray Gun bores through the target by disassembling it at the atomic level. Upon impact, the ray disintegrates the target's molecular structure, leading to direct death if any vital body parts are hit.";
set 16 "The current flamethrower can be loaded with various highly toxic and flammable liquids. When fired, the high compression of the liquid used ensures high efficiency and firepower.";
set 17 "The Combat Knife is the improved version of the Special Alloy knife which was developed by the military. Cold-rolled carbon-steel and high quality workmanship give this melee combat weapon very good efficiency and durability.";
set 18 "Six extra-hardened, tungsten-carbon cold-forged stainless-steel blades make the Claw one of the most dangerous melee weapons.";
set 19 "This Double-Edged Sword is more than the ordinary swords our ancestors used in the early Dark Ages. This masterpiece from the Tangent high-tech weapon forges is a sub atomic forged, extra-hardened and nearly unbreakable long sword with absolute lethal impact. If handled correctly, that is.";
set 20 ".";
set 21 "Riot Shotgun shells contain 20 small lethal pellets that are spread out in a wide pattern when fired. Available in different ammo-types.";
set 23 "Archaic 'Doped-Insulator Lasers', which focus light through crystal or glass lenses that have been doped with chemicals, are used in these enhancements. The laser pointer emits a pencil-thin laser beam that is capable of maintaining its power and direction for several hundred meters. The low power of this laser makes it nearly invisible in the air, and can only be seen with the naked eye when the beam encounters something that reflects or refracts it. This creates the famous 'red dot' effect that allows one to aim better. However, if there are a large number of particles in the air, the beam is refracted off them, creating a clear line, thus reducing the range that the laser can be projected. The power requirement for this enhancement is low enough that it can be kept running almost indefinitely, with only a 21st century kinetic energy system. The introduction of the generic weapon port and the subsequently modified model of the laser allow it to be mounted on every weapon.";
set 24 ".";
set 25 "A modern-day version of the old fashioned 20th century battery, the Energy Pack is comprised of slates of platinum and osmium, partially submerged in liquid gellium, a super-conductive metal. The platinum and osmium plates are connected to diodes that lead out of the Energy Pack, and connect through the load (in most cases a weapon) to complete the circuit. As the load draws off the energy pack, electrons flow from the platinum, through the load, and into the osmium, building up within the gellium.";
set 26 "Initially designed by Tangent Technologies as a precision cutting tool for NexT Systems' construction yards, it was later redesigned as a melee weapon. The Laser Sword uses a tapered torus-shaped nozzle to direct a helium-gas laser into a cone-like beam from the weapons hilt, which contains an energy capsule. By using a partly-silvered mirror, a unique prism is created. The Laser Sword causes intense heat damage, and can cut through many types of armor. Due to its small size and weight, it has become the weapon of choice for many professional soldiers. Its elegant appearance has caught the attention of the city's elite upper-class. Many carry it as a show of status.";
set 27 "The laser blade of the Big Laser Sword is formed via a high-energy, continuous wave, gas operated, helium-neon laser. The helium-neon is encased in a quartz rod, which forms the handle of the sword. Two silver mirrors, one only partly silvered so that a beam can leave the cavity at each side of the glass tube, form the laser cavity. The light emission is initiated by an ultraviolet flashlight, which is powered by a micro cold-fusion reactor. \n \nThe first models of the Big Laser Sword used a carbon-dioxide laser. Although this type is more powerful than a helium-neon laser, its color purity and frequency stability is lower, and its beam dispersion index is higher.";
set 28 "Simple ways to improve a user's chances in hand-to-hand combat have always been common. In the early days, things such as chains were worn around the fists to inflict more damage. However, because the chains hadn't been properly cushioned, they not only hurt the opponent, but the user as well.\n\nFighting with Brass Knuckles is the same as fighting with bare fists.  The metal is used in order to inflict more damage when landing a proper blow. The knuckles are cushioned on the insides so that the metal does not hurt the user when he strikes his opponent.";

The metal is used in order to inflict more damage when landing a proper blow. The knuckles are cushioned on the insides so that the metal does not hurt the user when he strikes his opponent. Knuckles fashioned with brass are more massive, and do greater damage.";
set 30 "Silencers are devices used to reduce noise levels from the discharge of firearms. A Silencer is no more than a series of baffles, coupled to an expansion chamber, with some kind of device allowing it to be mounted on the barrel. NOTE: A Silencer fitted onto a gun that fires supersonic ammo will do little to quiet the overall noise. There will still be a distinctive 'crack' as the bullet punches through the sound barrier, even though the expansion of gasses from the gun will be muffled.\n\nFor a Silencer to be effective, it must be used with projectiles that travel at less than the speed of sound. In such cases, the noise of the discharge is greatly reduced, and may not even be recognizable as the firing of a gun to a bystander.  The latest innovation in muzzle-mounted Silencers is the so-called 'Wet' Silencer. These designs employ water or other liquids to absorb the temperature of the expanding gasses, therefore reducing their rate of expansion and consequent noise.";
set 31 "An Optic-Electronic Scope with multi-zoom and integrated target identification.  Mountable on various types of weapons.";
set 32 "The Junk-Knife is the favorite weapon of the smaller mutants. Completely assembled out of trash and junk, it is the cheap, but less efficient alternative to the other knives available.";
set 33 "This weapon is a new variation on the old Taser.  It would probably not stop anything big, but it is effective against smaller vermin.  The Electro-Shocker quickly ramps up a charge (instead of releasing a full burst instantly), which saves power and allows it to function almost indefinitely without a recharge.  This is a good weapon for unskilled citizens who are looking for a little more punch than their fists.";
set 34 "Although created as a tool, the nail gun has become a popular and extremely cheap weapon, often used by mutants and muggers.";
set 35 "In a world where life was becoming increasingly more difficult, a hunter or even just a civilian could get in trouble very quickly. They couldn't afford to get hurt far in the Outzone, and then have to limp back to Neocron to get patched up.  However, in response to this new market opportunity, every neighborhood store that had a pharmacy began to sell 'Stimkits'. These were usually filled with low quality steroids that didn't do any actual healing. But after a few years of testing, some major medical companies began producing professional Medkits. These kits contained most of the things an injured human would need to get patched up. These kits actually healed wounds and kept them from getting infected, instead of just deadening the body's nerves in that area.";
set 36 "The small Medkits are much more reminiscent of the older 'Stimkits'.  They contain more painkilling properties than healing, but at a lower price, it's worth it.";
set 37 "As conflict grew within the city, weapons manufacturers soon realized the demand for a more compact, lighter-weight version of the current energy weapons being used. Soon, top engineers at the Tangent division of BioTech Industries, Inc. mastered the art of micro-weapon design and production, leading to a steady flow of energy pistol weapons into the city. \n\nThe Plasma Pistol uses a combination of plasma formation methods to maximize effectiveness. The intense heat of the plasma (approximately 10°6 K) incinerates almost anything in its path, inflicting severe heat damage on the target. This, in combination with the kinetic energy of the beam's acceleration, makes it one of the most powerful pistols available.";

Its effect on the target is somewhat unique. When struck by the beam, the target's component atoms reassemble as a fine mist that slowly dissipates. The mist is small enough to be absorbed through most air filters, leading to a pretty grisly, though mostly bloodless, aftermath. The effect of the Ray gun decreases noticeable with increasing length of the ray."; 		//new

It does so by making the neurons throughout the targeted individual's nervous system more negatively charged, making it harder, if not impossible, for most neurons to create action potentials for a short time, thus stunning and disorienting the individual who has been hit.";
set 41 "Brain Implants come in many makes and models. All of them are inserted directly into a specific area of the brain. The target area varies per type of implant. As the brain is a very delicate organ, many brain implants have negative effects tied to their positive effects.";
set 42 "Offering the ability of concealment and a delivery of superior firepower in close-quarters combat, the Sub-Machine Gun has become the most favored side arm of bodyguards and security personnel. The Sub-Machine Gun has also been known to be the preferred backup weapon for many soldiers of the City Mercs. \n\nFiring a burst of bullets, the Sub-Machinegun causes piercing damage to the target. Bleeding, both external and internal, is the most common effect, though other kinds of damage can be caused when the Sub-Machine Gun is loaded with non-standard munitions. ";
set 43 "The ultimate short-range rifle. The Shotgun fires two shells simultaneously through its double barrels. Manual pump action reloads the weapon from a magazine of shells. The shotgun, sometimes referred to as the 'sewer sweeper', is extremely reliable and can be loaded with a variety of high-powered munitions.  \n\nForce damage is the most common effect of the shotgun's standard load. When hit, the crushing impact of several hundred pellets can knock an armored target off its feet. An unarmored target may find itself with a gaping wound of shredded flesh and shattered bone. Other types of ammunition fired from the Shotgun will cause damage ranging from severe burns to concussive blast damage.";
set 44 "The Street Rifle is the favorite weapon of the mutants. Although it is completely assembled out of junk, the Street Rifle has high firepower, long range, and high reliability. The Street Rifle uses 7.62 mm full metal jacket ammo by default.";
set 45 "Originally used by CityAdmin for crowd control at the launching sites of the first ships destined for the Irata 3 colony, the Freezer fires a negative-ion pulse that is designed to slow the actions of the affected target. It does this by making the neurons throughout the nervous system more negatively charged. This makes it harder, if not impossible, for most neurons to create action potentials for a short time, thus stunning and disorienting the targeted individual. The freezer is powered by a small battery pack, and is very energy efficient. Because of the specialized technology used in the Freezer, it is rather large. A good weapon overall for crowd control, but somewhat heavy.";
set 46 "BioTech Industries, Inc, manufactures the Fusion Rifle as a heavier duty version of the fusion pistol. The Fusion Rifle's greater power can be attributed to its larger (albeit less efficient) capacitors and power handling system. It also boasts increased accuracy due to its longer barrel and reactive magnetic containment technology.  BioTech also improved its rate of fire by tweaking the FID maximum efficiency. \n\nThe rifle's results are similar to those of the pistol. Any material caught within the initial blast radius comes out looking like melted plastic. The only effective defense against fusion shots is energy-resistant armor. Due to its fusion technology the fusion pistol delivers most damage near to its maximum range.";

Even more than his own wife, who as a consequence felt lonely and was cheating on him with another man. He had carried many internal wounds in his life, but none hurt as much as those inflicted upon learning of his wife's betrayal. Thus one day he took his best rifle in hand, one which he had made himself, and with it killed his wife and her lover, before turning the gun on himself. It was his only way out, the only way for him to ease the unbearable inner pain that was driving him mad. The murder weapon disappeared soon after...";

This wasn't right, she lost her trust in a good willed God and in her burned the heart of an assain longing for nothing but retaliation. She had nothing to lose. Her only desire to erase all the leading heads of the Syndicate. In the most important moment, with the first shot, the weapon developed an impossible power, which killed 3 Tsunami members at once and destroyed the wall behind them. Surprised and stunned by this power, she wasn't able to protect herself from the other guards. Seconds later she was dead ... the weapon got lost in the chaos ...";

One stormy evening while he was working late, an organized gang of runners broke into his lab and stole the blueprints and one completed Freezer weapon prototype. Thinking only to protect his work, he gave chase to the burglars but as he got outside the doors, one of the runners turned around and used the Freezer prototype against him. At least he tried, however the moment he pulled the trigger, a great flash streaked from the sky directly into the freezer and killed the runner. The weapon was some how strengthened by this, and to this day no other freezer ever built was able to match the power of that single gun. Years later the weapon was again stolen, it's where abouts are still unknown.";

One day he awoke from his Cryo-sleep and heard about how Twilight Guardian terrorists had entered the inner city of Neocron and dealt heavy damage. Together with a squad of STORM troops he chased them to the final fight. But he was not ready for the surprise of finding the enemy wielding an unbelievably mighty weapon which fired balls of fusioning plasma, destroying even the STORM bots in seconds. Jerod Parker found his long waited retirement on the streets of Neocron. After that encounter, the weapon was not seen in action again.";
set 524 "Dr. Maria Law's work was developing techniques for the medical uses of lasers. She dedicated many years of her life to the goal of developing a specialised laser which would be capable of neutralising special cells or nanites in the human body without wounding. Her experiments didn't get much attention or funding as her sponsors were unhappy with the lack of results and proofs of concept. A big unknown company then bought the rights to the whole project and built an effective laser based on her work, but designed for military purposes. The weapon never went into production after the project was sabotaged (rumoured to be the work of Archer and Wesson). The prototype disappeared shortly after the company closed the labs.";
set 525 "Cervantes Talos was a crazy man, or so went the rumours around the city. Others however, thought he was a genius and others again merely thought of him as slightly odd. But whatever they thought, people were never comfortable getting too close to him, maybe because no one had ever known as much about weapons as he did. Sometimes he would not be seen for weeks, as he was shut away in his lab working on his weapons. He would reverse engineer them, micro-manage and alter the calibration, then reconstruct them again in a subtly different way. One time, he exceeded even his own high expectations, creating a new and immensely powerful plasma rifle with a grace and perfection unseen before or since. However the word is defined, this gun became his first and only love, to him it meant more than any living being he had ever known - charming, beautiful and lethal. It is not known what happened to him or the gun afterwards.";
set 526 "Jude Fey was well known as an absolute master hacker. His brain contained few remaining organic areas, the rest filled with the endless nano-circitry of implants, causing him to act more like a machine than a man. No one should have survived more then five brain implants, but he replaced step by step all parts of his brain with their technological counterparts. He was still himself in a way, but more of a technological copy of his former organic soul, right down to the thoughts in his head. He was also, without a doubt, one of the most impressive engineering marvels of all time, a human who isn't a human. He was able to interface directly with his weapons, able to calculate distance, direction and frequency in only few nanoseconds with lethal effects. One day however during a fire fight, he was hit by a massive burst of energy, deadly to a normal human. His soul got mixed up with the artificial intelligence of the plasma weapon he was using, while his body died. His electronic soul became one with the weapon, like a genie in a bottle, but burning with a deep and total hate of all free and living individuals. The resultant mighty weapon, is known and feared even to this day by all, even by someone lucky enough to find and wield it.";

Not all celebrated his success however, especially his less successful colleague Dr. Lao Chen. Chen decided to hire a hacker named Jude Fey to steal the information about McCoys projects, which Fey was able to accomplish with ease. McCoy upon discovering who hired the hacker, cursed Chen for this underhanded tactic, since the loss of the data led to the termination of McCoys projects. Lao Chen used his stolen information to construct two prototypes, but from there things began to go very wrong. In the first tests one of the prototypes exploded causing massive damage to the labs, destroying the data and killing Chen himself. Archer and Wesson's attempts to redevelop the weapon failed at every turn. The second prototype then disappeared, and A&W was no longer able to continue, since even McCoy couldnt help anymore, having been killed in an 'accident'.";
set 528 "Shantai Guinea was a high-level leader in the Black Dragon clan. One day his brother Sven Guinea was murdered and Shantai ordered a thorough investigation. It was discovered that the Black Dragon clan had been betrayed from somewhere within. Further investigations narrowed the traitor down to one of two people, Gon Ramone and Jeremia Sea. Both were interrogated and both protested their innocence all the way through. Finally, Shantai decided that it must have been Gon who killed his brother and betrayed the clan. Shantai leveled his plasma pistol, which he had taken from his brothers possessions, at Gon to kill him in retaliation for Sven's death. As he pulled the trigger, the lethal bursts of plasma flew out of the barrel, not at Gon, but at Jeremia, who was split into two by the massive power of the superheated plasma. Some time later evidence was discovered that Jeremia was actually the traitor, proving the gun had known what Shantai had not. From that day onwards, Shantai only used and trusted this one weapon, his brothers final legacy. At a later date Shentai didn't return from a mission, and since then he and this legendary weapon have been lost, perhaps forever.";

After his eventual death, he was buried with his possessions in a grave out in the Wastelands. Grave robbers looted this grave and quickly realised that this weapon wasn't normal, but a mighty instrument of destruction. It was not the reflexes of the legendary Wyatt Earp that killed all those people, it was this gun with and its mighty powers of unknown origin.

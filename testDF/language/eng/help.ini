set 2100 "Important Notice: Player versus Player Combat – the ''Law Enforcer''";
set 2101 "This notice contains important information explaining how player versus player combat is handled.\n\nDescription:\nEvery player in Neocron starts with a special head implant. The implant is called ''Law Enforcer''. This chip makes sure that won’t get into fights with other players. Other players can not hurt you and you can not hurt other players, as long as you have this chip implanted.\n\nLimitations:\nThe only limitation the ''Law Enforcer'' brings is the fact that you can not join a clan.\n\nRemoval:\nUnlike all the other implants, implanting or de-implanting the ''Law Enforcer'' can be done without an implanting tool. You can simply pull him out of your implant window (F3) and drag it into your inventory window (F2). You can implant the chip afterwards in a similar way. This is only possible as long as your character has not reached skill level 30. After reaching skill level 30 you can not re-implant your ''Law Enforcer''.\n\nWarning:\nThink twice before removing your ''Law Enforcer''! You will be an easy prey for more experienced players the moment that your “Law Enforcer” is removed. Be sure to have some strong friends, which are able to help you and protect you. You should look for a clan that wants to recruit you. You will find experienced players in a clan. They can get you some good tips and perhaps even some nice equipment.\n\nSave Zones:\nEven after removing your “Law Enforcer”, there are some areas where you can not be attacked by other players. These zones are called ''Save Zones''. The headquarters of your faction (check your faction under the F6 Menu) is such a ''Save Zone''. Make sure to check your headquarters out, so you can learn more about your faction and make some faction related friends.";

In this window you will also have the possibility to activate your local map and the world map. For new players, the navigation system itself is more important.\n\nNavray:\nIn the upper area of the ''Navray'' window you can select a target that is located in your vicinity. This means that you can only find NC targets when you are in Neocron and DoY targets when you are located in Dome of York. When you have selected your target, you can activate the navigation system by pressing the ''Start''-button. The system will now direct you to your target. The directions can come in two forms, the first is a dotted line and the second is a big arrow in the upper area of your screen. When you have reached your destination the system will automatically deactivate.\n\nFirst Destination:\nYou should definitely visit your faction headquarters if you are a new player. Select your faction from the list in the ''Navray'' window and activate the navigation system. The system can also be used to find a specific shop located in your city.\n\nThe Maps:\nThere are three maps available for every player: \n - The mini-map is a little map showing you the direct vicinity in a small window (in the upper left corner). You can (de-)activate it using its shortcut (ALT+M).\n - The sector map shows you the complete zone in a new window.\n - The world map is a full screen map of the Neocron wastelands.";

After being activated by using the ''activate''-button, the GenRep can be used as a destination when using its teleporting ability or as a respawn point after being killed. The GenRep of your first apartment is automatically activated, so you will always have a safe haven available.\n\nDeath in Neocron:\nIf you die in Neocron, you can select a previously activated GenRep to get yourself replicated. The replication process temporarily affects your abilities and skills, which will regenerate after time. This means that it is possible that you cannot use several parts of your equipment until your skills have regenerated sufficiently. The exact status of the ''Synaptic Impairment'' can be found in the Skill window (F5), where a status bar in the upper left corner indicates the current loss in abilities and skills.\n\nYour Backpack:\nIf you die in Neocron, everything that you had on you will drop into your backpack. The backpack can be found at the location where you died. Your backpack is your own and no one else has access to its contents. You can choose to pickup your backpack yourself or use the GenRep and press the ''Recover Backpack'' button. This action will return your backpack to your inventory for a price.\n\nThe Loot Belt:\nIf you have removed your ''Law Enforcer'' you will drop, besides your backpack, a loot belt when you die. This belt contains a random item of your quick belt. The first slot of your quick belt is protected and can not be transferred to the loot belt. Unlike the backpack, the loot belt can not be recovered using the GenRep System. You will have to get it yourself. Everyone that is able to hack the integrated lock will be able to loot your belt.";

In the beginning of your career it is not advisable to train anything else besides combat, as your abilities will develop faster when fighting monsters.

By the way: many Engineers also train their skills with Pistols (P-C) so that they can defend themselves if the situation arises. You should deter from using Rifles (R-C), as you would have to waste too much time on learning how to aim (WPL) them. Using Pistols on the other hand almost requires no training in aiming.

Your physical celerity is of equally great importance, thus you should practice your Agility (AGL) and Athletics (ATL).

Whenever you are in in a squad, death is a word that no-one fears, because of you it's become nothing more than a minor setback. Don’t get too cocky though, many skilled field medics have been brought down by enemy snipers, and the moment a field medic goes down, is the moment that decides the battle. As experience has shown you, you carry a great responsibility.  You will be hated by few, loved by many for your skills. How you choose to use them is up to you.";

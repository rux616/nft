--Compression engine: ZLib (unknown version)

--NC Single-File Structure
  First 16 bytes of every NC Compressed File.  

  0A|F7|3D|88|84|75|84|93|BD|EF|FD|AB|us|us|us|us

  us = Uncompressed Size

  The rest of the file is the compressed data.

--NC Multi-File (PAK) Structure
  First 8 bytes of every PAK file.

  DE|8C|45|3D|nf|nf|nf|nf

  nf = Number of files contained in PAK archive.

  After those 8 bytes comes the file descriptors.
  20 bytes|filepath\filename.fileextension|null byte (00)

  of|of|of|of|lo|lo|lo|lo|cs|cs|cs|cs|us|us|us|us|fl|fl|fl|fl|filepath\filename.fileextension|00

  of = Offset of how many bytes until the start of the next file descriptor (added to the address of the first 'of' byte)
  lo = Address of the start of the compressed file inside the PAK
  cs = Compressed Size
  us = Uncompressed Size
  fl = Length of "filepath\filename.fileextention + nullchar" string following 4 byte 'fl' descriptor

--NOTE: All sizes are in reverse.  So if something has a size of 09|0A|00|00 in a file, it should be read as 00|00|0A|09

--NOTE2: After the TOC, there is *NO PADDING* between the files stored in the pak.  Example:

  ...EndOfFile1][StartOfFile2......EndOfFile2][StartOfFile3...
